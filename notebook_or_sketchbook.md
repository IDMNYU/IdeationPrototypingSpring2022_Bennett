# Notebook (or Sketchbook)

Acquire some kind of bound notebook or sketchbook to collect ideas, questions, loves, hates, inspiration, drawings, photos, visual and textual scraps, ephemera, fragments, imprints, rubbings, stains, odds and ends. Choose a notebook that is small enough that you will most likely keep with you (eg. pocket-sized or slightly larger) and use. This book must be new this semester or only lightly used previously. Make it your own with stickers, markers, paint, collage, whatever. Carry this notebook with you at all times (as well as something to write with and a gluestick or tape) and use it often.

You will document your analog notebook on a weekly basis through photos or videos posted to your process site. 


## Additional Prompts 

For many students, this sketchbook maybe a first one for you. You may be wondering of how to use this. If you are still struggling remember the following:

* This sketchbook is not only for this class. Don't think of it as a notebook for this course work (ie, notes from class, sketches for coursework, and/or solely coursework). Instead, think of it as a collection tool for things you are drawn to. Ideas. Think of it as an external brain. Think of it as a sandbox to experiment. 

* For ideas on different ways to use your sketchbook and for different exercises, check out the <a href = "sketch_journalPrompts.md"> prompts and experiment. </a> Have fun and cut loose!
