###### Sketch: Orthographic & Curved Planes


 - Sketchbook: Fill a page, exploring the orthographic views of an object, in front and side views. Then simplify that form into basic geometric shapes using two point perspective and divide it along parting lines. Re-draw it with details and features; Then again showing how it might work, move or operate

 - Sketchbook: Fill 2 pages exploring orthographic views of a simple shape/object (ie, cube), from different viewing angles, envisioning how a shape might move, open or unfold

 - Sketchbook: Fill 2 pages exploring curvilinear lines and forms. Draw a series of fair curves towards your body. Draw another series of fair curves away from your body. Notice the difference in control, regarding your body position.

 - Sketchbook: Practice drawing curved planes. Fill a page or 2 drawing ribbons. Think of the fair curves, using minimal distortion, and only curved on two edges. Play with line weight and the contour lines. Consider drawing light interior lines to show the contour of the distorted surface.
