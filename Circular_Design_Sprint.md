We live in a world of finite resources. We are facing a critical time for our planet as we are experiencing rapid climate change and great loss of biodiversity. It's imperative to address our resources and to limit our disposal of materials.

Circular Design refers to creating products or services that promote or foster a product's circularity from a user perspective and moves away from linear consumation and waste
