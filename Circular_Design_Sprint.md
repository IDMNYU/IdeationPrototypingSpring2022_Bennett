### DM-UY 1143 A Ideation and Prototyping

We live in a world of finite resources. We are facing a critical time for our planet as we are experiencing rapid climate change and great loss of biodiversity. It's imperative to address our resources and to limit our disposal of materials.

Circular Design refers to creating products or services that promote or foster a product's circularity from a user perspective and moves away from linear consumation and waste.

People engage in circular consumption in many different ways: renting, leasing, borrowing, and buying pre-used products. There are three main phases: obtainment (gaining ownership or access), use, and clearance (resigning ownership or access).

#### Semester week 3/Week 1 Circular Design Sprint: Launch, Investigation, & Ideation

In class Monday:
- Circular Design Overview; Sprint Launch
- Break into groups
- Brainstorm products

In class Wednesday:

Work in Groups:

Goal: What are critical hinderances to circular consumption? This exercise should unveil several, which you can use as launching points for what you brainstorm and create. Explore the given circumstances, study them thoroughly, and to look more closely. Through ideation exercises, you should be able to delve more deeply into your topic.



1. What is the life span of the object? What other related activites or supporting items/actions does this object require? Are there particular feelings about participating in a circular transaction? How can these be mitigated?

Answer the questions above with word lists, brain storms, and concept mapping

2. Then use The Circular Design Ideation pack (pink cards), ideate and explore your chosen further. Explore possibilities of:

	- Extending Use
	- Multiple Use Cycles
	- Designing for Exchange
	- Designing for Circular Match-making. 


3. How can these aspects be addressed by your design proposal? Make note of your process and document. Sketch, draw and map things out.

4. Discuss The Pocket Universal Methods of Design (TPUMD) possibilities as a group and strategize who is doing what research exercise design. Discuss several possibilites each, by skimming the text. Then choose 1 each as an activity to do for homework (due next Thursday). Or create new research strategy. Document your process and reflect on the execution, posting to your Process Site. 

Homework:
- Review Use2Use Activation Pack cards
- Review The Pocket Universal Methods of Design (TPUMD)
- Pick 1 Processes (Each) from TPUMD that would be good to enact in order to gain information. In other words, pick 1 different exercise each (no one from the group should be doing the same one) and finish designing/fleshing them out, them with reference to your product in particular
