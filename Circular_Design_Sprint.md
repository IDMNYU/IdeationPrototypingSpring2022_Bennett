### DM-UY 1143 A Ideation and Prototyping
##### Spring 2022 • Katherine Bennett • Mon/Wed 2:00PM-3:50PM • 370 Jay Room 309


We live in a world of finite resources. We are facing a critical time for our planet as we are experiencing rapid climate change and great loss of biodiversity. It's imperative to address our resources and to limit our disposal of materials.

Circular Design refers to creating products or services that promote or foster a product's circularity from a user perspective and moves away from linear consumption and waste.

People engage in circular consumption in many different ways: renting, leasing, borrowing, and buying pre-used products. There are three main phases: obtainment (gaining ownership or access), use, and clearance (resigning ownership or access).


#### Semester week 6/Week 4 Circular Design Sprint

- Show evidence of your Prototyping as well as how your idea is progessing and developing with regards to Circular Design. Write a short reflect with all content uploaded.

- Brainstorm a presentation which is creative (ie not a formal slide deck and a precise walk through of your process) and shows the depth of your process. This presentation is NOT to be a walk through of your process. Your blog has been evidence of that. Instead, take all the research, knowledge, revelations and prototying and create a short (3-8 minute) presentation in-class on March 9th. 

	This presentation could be:
		- A pitch to Angel Investors for funding for your business service/product <br>
		- A video commercial advertising your business or product <br>
		- A pitch to a government or school board for buy-in, support, or funding. <br>
		- A Public Service Announcement/Campaign for your project or service <br>

Research these to get an idea on how to riff on these and to apply them to your presentation.

These presentations are meant to be rough (not high fidelity; notes and speaking tools are acceptable), yet, they need to show the depth of your process (meaning design thinking exercises/steps) by how you describe your product/service, it's need, it's viability, it's fit into the environment, various users, etc. The idea and heart of your presentation is more important than the polish. Use sketches and drawings to show the item or the process/service. These presentations are meant to be fun and a bit lighthearted, while still conveying the content of your research. Think of you, not as you, but another character that is giving the presentation (ie, start-up founder, engineer, designer, policy maker, artist, etc). You are not you, as a NYU student in this course walking through the ups and downs regarding what you've done over the last few weeks for this project. Instead, you are acting as someone else.

These are SHORT 3-8 minute presentations. Practice, as you will be timed. Get your materials together. Brainstorm and document the process of how and what you are presenting. Post all of this to your Process site.


#### Semester week 5/Week 3 Circular Design Sprint

- Ideation
	- Brainstorming
	- Negative Storming
	- 3/4 - 3 - 5 Method
- Protyping
	- CEP + CFP
	- Dark Horse
	- Imagine The Future

#### Semester week 4/Week 2 Circular Design Sprint


Post evidence of your process of each of these (Problem Statement, Stakeholder map, Personas, Jobs To Be Done & Customer Journey). For each of them, tell me a where you are at, as a result of each of the exercises. What developed as a result of the exercise? What shifted or changed as a result of the exercise?

###### Post half of these (if not them all) by 3/1/22 noon; The rest are due by the following week.

- Create The Problem Statement
	- Note that the problem statement never starts nor includes the solution. It is about understanding the problem.
	- An example of a problem statement: “How might be redesign …[what?]….[for whom?]…so that ….[ specific need] … is satisfied?”
	- Tools to exlpore and help create a problem statement:
			- 5W + H Questions: What, Why, Who, When, Where, How
			- Context Maps
			- Cause - Effect Diagrams
- Create a Stakeholder Map of all the concerned/interested people along the entire scope of the problem. These include people with a vested interest, as well as competitors and naysayers.
	- Tools:
		- See the slide deck (DesignThinking_UnderstandObserveDefine) in Slack Resources
		- See PDF tool in Slack Resources
- Create 2-3 Personas (fictional character who is a potential user)
	- See the slide deck (Observering Emotions) in Slack Resources
	- Tools:
		- PDF in Slack
		- [Miro](https://miro.com/) also has a template
		- More discussion and examples [here](https://github.com/IDMNYU/IdeationPrototypingSpring2022_Bennett/blob/main/Personas.md)
- Outline/List all the jobs the user/customer/client needs to do (ie, Jobs To Be Done)
	- Captures the user/customer/client tasks in a structured way
	- Uncovers hidden tasks
	- When I .....I want to ........so I can ....
	- See the slide deck (Observering Emotions) in Slack Resources
	- Tools:
		- PDF in Slack
- Using one of your Personas, and Jobs to Be Done or another scenario, create a Customer Journey Map
	- See the slide deck (Observering Emotions) in Slack Resources
	- Tools:
		- Card deck exercise from class (See Slack Circular Design Sprint)
		- Customer Journey Map PDF in Slack Resources




#### Semester week 3/Week 1 Circular Design Sprint: Launch, Investigation, & Ideation

In class Monday:
- Circular Design Overview; Sprint Launch
- Break into groups
- Brainstorm products

In class Wednesday:

Work in Groups:

Goal: What are critical hinderances to circular consumption? This exercise should unveil several, which you can use as launching points for what you brainstorm and create. Explore the given circumstances, study them thoroughly, and to look more closely. Through ideation exercises, you should be able to delve more deeply into your topic.



1. What is the life span of the object? What other related activites or supporting items/actions does this object require? Are there particular feelings about participating in a circular transaction? How can these be mitigated?

Answer the questions above with word lists, brain storms, and concept mapping. Post your maps and lists to your Process site.

2. Then use The Circular Design Ideation pack (pink cards), ideate and explore your chosen further. Explore possibilities of:

	- Extending Use
	- Multiple Use Cycles
	- Designing for Exchange
	- Designing for Circular Match-making. 

Visually demonstration this ideation through word lists and concept maps. (Post to your site)

3. How can these aspects be addressed by your design proposal? Make note of your process and document. Sketch, draw and map things out. Post to your site.


4. Discuss The Pocket Universal Methods of Design (TPUMD) possibilities as a group and strategize who is doing what research exercise design. Discuss several possibilites each, by skimming the text. Then choose 1 each as an activity to do for homework (due next Thursday). Or create new research strategy. Document your process and reflect on the execution, posting to your Process Site. 

Homework:
- Post your mindmaps, concept maps and word lists from 1-3. You should have multiple maps and lists for each number. Not just 1-2 total
- Review Use2Use Activation Pack cards
- Review The Pocket Universal Methods of Design (TPUMD)
- Pick 1 Processes (Each) from TPUMD that would be good to enact in order to gain information. In other words, pick 1 different exercise each (no one from the group should be doing the same one) and finish designing/fleshing them out, them with reference to your product in particular
